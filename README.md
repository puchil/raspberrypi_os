# Porting Minix to Raspberry Pi

As an software engineer, I want to learn all the parts of an OS. Rather than implementing a new OS 101, I feel the best way to learn would be to use an existing OS and port to a hardware.

##Goal (My thoughts)
1. Port Minix to Raspberry Pi 4.
1. Make it usable wih all programming tools and a GUI
1. Port Minix to all other Raspberry Pi models
1. Allow minimal and full stack of Raspberry Pi
   1. Minimal would just be the base kernel
   1. Full would be the GUI/All tools and utils with a full blown GUI
